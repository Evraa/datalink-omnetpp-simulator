# datalink-omnetpp-simulator
Simulating Data Link protocol.

In this project we demonstrate the main functionalities of the data link layer protocols; framing, and error detection and correction.
Applying flow control management via the Go Back N algorithm.
Within a distributed (mesh like) architecture.

## To Run
  + Download the free tool omnetpp, move the project to samples directory, and run the simulation.
  + You may tune the parameters on the omnetpp.ini file, in src directory if you're using linux based system, in simulation directory for windows users.
